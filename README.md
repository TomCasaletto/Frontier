# Frontier
Frontier is an app that lets you give it your location and then returns a list of accessible resources nearby. For example, it might tell you the nearest open restaurants, the nearest open gas stations, the nearest public wifi hotspots, the nearest public restrooms, or the nearest open towing/mechanic shops.


## Mockups
We intend to build Frontier as a hybrid web/mobile HTML app so that it is usable on any device.

#Setup using a Virtual Machine

1. [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
1. [Download Ubuntu ISO](http://www.ubuntu.com/) (or your favorite distro . These instructions are Debian-based.)
1. Live boot Ubuntu with Virtual Box. After installation, install these packages via terminal:
  * `sudo apt-get update`
  * `sudo apt-get install git`
  * `sudo apt-get install nodejs`
  * `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`
  * `sudo apt-get install npm`
  * `sudo apt-get install docker.io`
1. Clone repo, install dependencies:
  *  `git clone https://github.com/codeforhuntsville/Frontier`
  * `cd Frontier`
  * `npm install`
1. Setup docker
  * `sudo usermod -aG docker <your Linux username>`
  * Reboot the server
  * Log back in.
  * `docker build -t "frontier" .` (Lowercase, and notice the dot at end)
  * `make build`
1. Run the server:
  * `make run GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=supersecretkey`

The server will start locally and on ngrok. The restaurants will not load because you do not have a Google Places API key yet. That key will replace `supersecretkey`. To stop the server, use Ctrl+C.


#Google Places Key

1. Go to https://code.google.com/apis/console/ to register for an API key.
1. Create a new project, (e.g. Frontier).
1. Select APIs in the left.
1. Register for "Google Places API Web Service" key (click the MORE link under Maps).
1. Enable the API.
1. Go to Credentials in the left.
1. Create a new Public Access browser key. Don't worry about IP restrictions (this is for development).
1. Your key will be generated. Use that key in place of `supersecretkey` each time you `make run GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=supersecretkey`
